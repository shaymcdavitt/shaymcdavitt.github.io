Built from a boiler plat, I designed this sit from the bottom up as an assignment in my  web typography class, finishing it (for now) May 6, 2020.
What started as a simple assignment for a class showed me how much I loved combining design with technology.
This proveed to be a completely new  way of thinking about how  to publish my  deesigns, using a  brand new language.
I think of this work as a puzzle, one piece doesnt fit, anotheer  always  will.   
It takes time and effort to  solve  but I wouldn't trade this for anything. 
Not only have I gained a portfolio site, it lead me to starting a minor in computer science.
Really allowing me to develope  the passion before entering this new world.
